In my junior year, I did a data visualization project with SaCa DataViz. I did this project to meet the requirements of object-oriented Modeling and Analysis course.

## What is Saca DataViz?
Saca DataViz is developed by Neusofta. It is a self-developed self-service data exploration and visualized analysis platform that provides multi-data source access, lightweight data modeling, self-service visualized analysis tools, interactive storyboards and other functions. Aim to offer business personnel the self-service data exploration and visualized analysis services with high efficiency and low costs so that they can deeply analyze data and thoroughly seek business value.You can learn more about the platform on Neusoft's official website: https://www.neusoft.com/Products/Platforms/2434/

In my opinion, the Saca platform is very similar to Tableau. 


## Steps of the project
### 1. Find a dataset
I got my dataset from https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/ (however, this dataset is now not public)

### 2. Understand the application scenario
First, students choose courses to meet graduation requirements. Through this link, I learned about UIUC's graduation requirements: http://catalog.illinois.edu/undergraduate/engineering/computer-science-bs/#degreerequirementstext 

Based on the graduation requirements, I have determined that my project should include two aspects: one is based on core courses, and the second is based on all courses.
